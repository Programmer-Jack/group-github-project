        <h1>// I AM JACK AUSTIN.</h1>
        <p>Howdy! This document serves to provide a bit of information about myself.</p>
        <p>Born in 2005 CE, I’m a citizen of the early twenty-first century. I love to explore the huge range of <u>art</u> and <u>technology</u> that this era provides. I like to investigate everything that interests me: I’ve dabbled in <u>digital photography,</u> <u>bread baking,</u> and <u>3D modeling;</u> I’ve learned <u>Spanish</u> in school and I’m learning <u>Hungarian</u> on the side.</p>
        <p>There are two things that I absolutely love spending my time on, and those are programming and music. Throughout high school, I would find myself spending hours on end designing games in the Unity engine, building terrains and interiors and creating the perfect lighting, and giving them life through code. In school, my favorite courses were my orchestra classes. I played viola and later learned violin, and arranged Kazuma Jinnouchi’s “Osiris Suite, Act 1” and conducted it for my final concert of high school.</p>
        <p>I have a personal philosophy that if you love a hobby enough, you owe it to yourself to put in the time when you can to work on it, especially when it is frustrating. Lately, I’ve been working to stay true to this philosophy by spending more time working on little software projects and practicing violin. I’ve found that I am at my best when I am dedicating myself to a major and difficult project.</p>

        <h2><strong>// Future</strong></h2>
        <p>A few fields have piqued my interest; I can imagine myself building powerful art games or designing music software. I’d like to leave behind work that has a tangible, positive impact on humanity.</p>
