                    This page is meant to give you a brief idea about who I am
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born in 2005, and grew up in California. All my life I have been surrounded by technology which influenced my interest in to studying computer science.
                </p>
                <p>
                   I have been extremely interested in computer science for a long time due to my many encounters with computer science. During my time doing computer science, I have worked on many projects and am looking to do more work on AI and machine learning. So far the programming languages that I know are Python, Java, C, and C++.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My interests outside of computer scinece consist of math and sports. I am a huge fan of analysis and looking at sports statistics, especially for sports such as football and basketball. I am hoping to combine my interests using data science and python libraries in order to make predictive analysis for sports. 
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, I want to work in software development and hopefully progress into doing AI. I hope to work in a tech company where I can have access to using AI tools so that I could hopefully design algorithm to do things that I am interested in.
