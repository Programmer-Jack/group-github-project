    // I am Luca Gebre-Mariam.
                </h1>
        <p>What’s up, I am Luca. I study comp sci at CU boulder. I don’t plan on
staying in a computer science career, and I refuse to be working the
standard job by 30, but I think computer science can teach me
valuable skills that I plan to use later.
I enjoy weight lifting, Combat sports and in general bettering myself. I
like to think about what work I am avoiding and try my best to do that
first. I always consider what is difficult and hard, and like to do those
things, because they are hard for a reason. I am a very optimistic
person and I always catch myself Imagining what is possible when I
apply myself.
<h2>In the future I have aspirations to use my computer science job to
invest in real estate, and I have many plans to reduce all my costs
drastically and have money to work with. Three other friends and I
have a goal of doing whatever we can to become rich, and we all plan
on using our respective degrees income to contribute to business</h2>
plans and ways of attaining financial freedom.</p>
